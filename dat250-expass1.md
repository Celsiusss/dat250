# DAT250 expass 1

I followed the guide from Heroku to deploy my app to a Heroku dyno.  
I used the Arch User Repository to install heroku-cli on my computer.

I cloned the example git repository and used the heroku-cli to create a new dyno and pushed the example java app to the heroku git origin. The app deployed successfully without any issues.

I also set up the project in Intellij IDEA, I opened up the project in the IDE and waited for the project to import and load fully, then clicked on "Start" and the application started. I navigated to http://localhost:5000 and verified that the application is running locally as well.
